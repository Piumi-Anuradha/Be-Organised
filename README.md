6. Click Save. Your live Github pages site is now deployed at the URL down.

## TESTING
### Principles of Automated Testing
In javascript, automated testings are performed with the use of software tools and frameworks to write and execute tests the code automatically. The main purpose of using the automated testing is to ensure that the code you write in the Javascript, functions correctly, maintains its integrity and to be able to work as expected as you make changes and updates to your codebase.

There are many types of testing in Javascript.
1. Unit Testing
The unit testing refers to testing individual units or functions of the Javascript code in isolation. You write test cases that check whether the particular function or component produces the output according to the given set of input. Some of the popular testing frameworks for Javascript for unit testing are Jasmine, Mocha, and Jest.

2. Integration Testing
Intigration testing involves in focusing on testing the interactions between different components or modules of your application. This testing ensures that these components work together as expected. Examples of tools of integration testing are Jest, Cypress and Selenium.

3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
E2E testing replicate the user interations with your application to ensure that it functions correctly as a whole. E2E testing often involves automating interactions with a web browser or a mobile application. Some of the popular types of E2E testings are Cypress, Puppeteer and WebDriver.io.

4. Functional Testing
Functional testing involves to verify that your application's features and functionalities work as expected. This mainly involves testing user interfaces, user flows, and user interactions. Examples of frameworks for functional testings are Testcafe and Playwrite.

5. Snapshot Testing
This testing involves in capturing the current state of the component or output and compares it to a previously saved "snapshot". Mostely this testing type is used to test the UI components to ensure that they do not unintentionally change their appearance or behaviour. Commonly used snapshot testing is Jest.

6. Performance Testing 
This type of testing involves on evaluating the performance characteristics of Javascript  code or application. Lighthouse and WebPageTest are some of the examples that can help assess factors such as page load times, resourse usage or overall performance.


### The benefits of Automated testing
* Faster Feedback
* Regression Testing (Unintended side effects)
* Increased confidence (Less likely to introduce bugs)
* Documentation (Test cases can be used as documentation for how different parts of the code should behave)



### Principles of Manual Testing

Manual Testing involve the process of testing software manually without using automated testing tools or scripts. Manual testing is done by a human tester who interacts with the application or code to identify or verify issues such as bugs, userbility problems and other issues that can effect the software's functionality or user experience.


### Some steps and techniques of manual testing

* Understanding the Requirements (The clear understanding of the requirements and expectations for the software before testing)

* Test Planning

* Test Execution (Run the code using a web browser, comand-line interface, or any other environment.)

* Positive and negative Testing (Positive testing is the functioning of the application as expected and negative testing involves checking how the application handles error and exceptions)

* Userbility Testing (Assessing the user interface for usability, consistancy and intuitiveness. And verify that the design follows best practices and that it is user-friendly)


### Testing in this application

Considering the automation and manual testing, in this application manual testings have been performed. And also other reasons for performing manual testings are, 
* Human observation can be used in this application which can be useful to offer user-friendly system.
* Automation tests can be time consuming when testing small changes in the codes. 

### W3C Validator
W3C Validator has been used to validate all three HTML pages and CSS pages.
The screen shots are as follows:

### HTML W3C Validator for index, stopwatch and todolist pages

 *****************
![Alt text](image.png)

**********************

### First time visitor
1. This application has a very easy allocation of the task that needs to be achieved and the time allocation is very straight forward that can be set easily and clearly.

2. In this application's user-friendly task allocations give the user an idea that how to organise your day to day tasks

3. Being able to view this application and use this application in a range of device sizes make our lives easier.



### Returning Visitor
* This application is very helpful when organising daily routines and working according to a stopwatch.

## LIGHTHOUSE
Chrome developer, Lighthouse has been used to test the performance, accesibility, the best practices and SEO of the web application.


Lighthouse
I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to allow me to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.
